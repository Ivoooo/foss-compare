# Design Assets Required for foss.compare

To complete the website branding and make it a "proper PWA", we need the following image assets to replace the placeholders.

Please provide these files and place them in the `public/` directory.

## 1. Favicon & App Icons
Used for browser tabs, bookmarks, and when installing the app on a mobile home screen.

*   **`public/favicon.ico`** (32x32px or 48x48px) - Standard legacy browser icon.
*   **`public/icon-192.png`** (192x192px, PNG) - Android home screen icon.
*   **`public/icon-512.png`** (512x512px, PNG) - Android splash screen / large icon.
*   **`public/apple-touch-icon.png`** (180x180px, PNG) - iOS home screen icon.

## 2. Social Sharing Image (Open Graph)
Used when the link is shared on Twitter, Slack, Discord, LinkedIn, etc.

*   **`public/og-image.png`** (1200x630px, PNG or JPG)
    *   Should include the logo/title ("foss.compare") and a tagline (e.g., "Find the perfect self-hosted solution").
    *   Keep text centered to avoid being cropped on some platforms.
